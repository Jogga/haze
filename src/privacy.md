# Privacy notices

## Newsletter

Thank you for your interest in the privacy notices for this newsletter. I'd like to inform you thoroughly and transparently on the protection of your personal data.


### Double opt-in and logging

To subscribe to this newsletter you have to do a double opt-in. This means that after submitting your email address on the https://haze.email website, I'll send you a confirmation email. You have to confirm your intention to subscribe to my newsletter by pressing the button in this email. This is a security measure to prevent strangers from signing people up for newsletters that they possibly don't want to receive.

Your sign up is logged to prove the subscription in accordance to the law. This includes saving the date of sign up and confirmation as well as the IP address. Changes to the data you supplied will be recored, too.


### MailChimp

I send the haze newsletter with Mailchimp, a service to send email marketing campaigns of the company Rocket Science Group, LLC, 675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE #5000, Atlanta, GA 30308, USA.

All subscribers' email addresses and other data described in the context of these privacy notices are saved on MailChimp's servers in the USA. MailChimp uses this data to send and analyze the haze newsletter on my instruction. According to the information MailChimp provides, they might use this data to optimize their services, for example to improve delivery and display of emails, or for economical purposes like determining the countries where subscribers are from. MailChimp however won't use your data to contact you and won't give your data to third parties.

I put my trust in the reliability and data safety of MailChimp. MailChimp is certified in the US-EU data protection treaty "privacy shield" and required to respect the EU data protection policy. I also entered into a data processing agreement with MailChimp. This is a contract requiring MailChimp to protect the data of haze subscribers, process the data according to their privacy policy and, most importantly, to not pass the data to third parties. You can review MailChimp's privacy policy [here](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/).


### Credentials

To sign up for this newsletter simply provide your email address. No other credentials are required.


### Statistical analytics

haze newsletters contain a web beacon. This is a pixel-sized image, which will be requested and downloaded from MailChimp's Servers upon opening the email. This request makes it possible to track technical information, like the browser you use, your IP address, and the time and date of the request. This information is used for technical improvements to the services.

As part of these statistical analytics it will be recorded if the newsletter is opened, when it's opened, and which links are clicked. This information can be matched to single recipients, but it is neither my nor MailChimp's intention to monitor single subscribers. These analytics help me to recognize how all subscribers like to read the newsletter, what kinds of layouts and content you prefer, and help me to create content you enjoy most.


### View newsletters on the web

In some cases you will be directed to MailChimp's websites. For example the newsletters may include a link to view the email on the web. If you want to update your credentials or unsubscribe from the list, you have to do it on MailChimp's website, too. A note of caution: MailChimp uses Cookies and partners like Google Analytics to process and evaluate individual-related data. I have no influence on the data collection MailChimp does. You can find further information in [MailChimp's privacy policy](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/). 


### Unsubscribe

You can unsubscribe from this newsletter anytime you like. This will immediately revoke your agreement to receiving these mails as well as your agreement to statistical analytics. Each newsletter includes a link to unsubscribe from the mailing list, Furthermore, you can unsubscribe <a href="http://email.us15.list-manage.com/unsubscribe?u={{ site.mailchimp_user_id }}&id={{ site.mailchimp_list_id }}">here</a>.


### Datenschutzgrundverordnung

According to the guidelines of the german Datenschutzgrundverordnung (DSGVO) which takes effect on May 25th 2018, I inform you that the agreement on the sending of email addresses is based on articles 6 paragraph 1 letter a, DSGVO as well as section 7 paragraph 2 number 3, or respectively paragraph 3 UWG (Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb). The collaboration with the service provider MailChimp, the conduct of statistical analytics, the logging of sign up are done based on my legitimate interest in accordance with article 6 paragraph 1 letter f DSGVO. The choices are based on my interest in a user friendly and safe newsletter service, which serves my economical interest, as well as the expectations of you, the subscribers.

I inform you that you can always disagree on the future processing of your individual-related data in accordance to the legal requirements according to article 21 DSGVO. You can disagree in particular with the data processing for purposes of direct marketing.

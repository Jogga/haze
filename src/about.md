# About

Hey, my name is Joachim, I’m a designer from Munich, Germany. Haze is a little side project I do just for fun.

I love listening to and discovering new music, compiling songs to playlists, and sharing them with others. With haze I challenge myself to do that regularly, and even a little more: Creating an artwork for each playlist, and writing down the thoughts and impressions I have while listening to the selected tracks.

The genres I enjoy most are indie rock, electronica, folk, and psychedelic music, but you might encounter the occasional hip-hop or R&B track. To keep things current, I’ll mostly include tracks that were released during the the month the playlist was issued. I publish the playlists on soundcloud and spotify. I am not affiliated with these services.

I built this site with jekyll, and host it on firebase. Feel free to check out the [source code](https://github.com/Jogga/haze).

# About

Hey, my name is [Joachim](https://twitter.com/joggaf), I'm a digital product designer from Munich, Germany. This is a little side project I do just for fun. 

I love listening to and discovering new music, compiling songs to playlists, and sharing them with others. While this can be done perfectly on Soundcloud or Spotify, I wanted to give myself a stricter template for these playlists: Creating an artwork for each list, and writing down the thoughts and feelings I have while listening to the music.

The genres I enjoy most are indie rock, electronica, folk, and psychedelic music, but you might encounter the occasional hip-hop or R&B track. To keep things current, I'll mostly include tracks that were released during the the month the playlist was issued. I publish the playlists on soundcloud and spotify. I am not affiliated with these services.

I built this site with jekyll, and host it on firebase. Check out the [source code](https://github.com/Jogga/haze/).
